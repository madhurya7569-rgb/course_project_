****ABSTRACT****

The Employee Benefit Management System is a C-based console application designed to manage and calculate employee benefits efficiently. The program allows users tO store, update, search, and delete employee information using structures. It calculates important salary-related deductions such as health insurance and retirement  benefits based on user-defined percentage values. The system also computes the total benefits and the net salary after deductions, providing a clear financial summary for each employee. With a user-friendly menu-driven interface, the project demonstrates the practical use of structures, functions, and arrays in C programming. This system is useful for understanding basic employee record management and benefit calculation techniques in real-world applications.
